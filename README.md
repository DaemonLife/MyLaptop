Add a apt-x like codec support for bluetooth music. Open this file
```
sudo nvim /usr/share/pipewire/pipewire.conf
```
And add this TO END OF THIS FILE:
~~~
# Remove sound.enable or turn it off if you had it set previously, it seems to cause conflicts with pipewire
#sound.enable = false;
# rtkit is optional but recommended
security.rtkit.enable = true;
services.pipewire = {
  enable = true;
  alsa.enable = true;
  alsa.support32Bit = true;
  pulse.enable = true;
  # If you want to use JACK applications, uncomment this
  #jack.enable = true;
  # use the example session manager (no others are packaged yet so this is enabled by default,
  # no need to redefine it in your config for now)
  #media-session.enable = true;
  
  media-session.config.bluez-monitor.rules = [
    {
      # Matches all cards
      matches = [ { "device.name" = "~bluez_card.*"; } ];
      actions = {
        "update-props" = {
          "bluez5.reconnect-profiles" = [ "hfp_hf" "hsp_hs" "a2dp_sink" ];
          # mSBC is not expected to work on all headset + adapter combinations.
          "bluez5.msbc-support" = true;
          # SBC-XQ is not expected to work on all headset + adapter combinations.
          "bluez5.sbc-xq-support" = true;
        };
      };
    }
    {
      matches = [
        # Matches all sources
        { "node.name" = "~bluez_input.*"; }
        # Matches all outputs
        { "node.name" = "~bluez_output.*"; }
      ];
      actions = {
        "node.pause-on-idle" = false;
      };
    }

How to use bluetooth. How?
~~~
bluetooth on
bluetoothctl scan
bluetoothctl pair [addres]
bluetoothctl trust [addres]

# And nex time connect like this:
bluetoothctl connect [addres]

# The device may not want to connect the first time. 
# Repeat the steps. In different order... 
# ... Well, good luck!
~~~
Now are you connected? Okey. Change sound channel at headphones.
~~~
pactl list sinks # devices list
# Are you sure you are connected? :)
# Ok next
pactl set-default-sink [number] # set it default
~~~
Now run simple gui program pavucontrol and configurate your headphones to best codec (SBC-XQ maybe).
~~~
pavucontrol
~~~
How to WiFi control? The easy way:
~~~
nmcli dev wifi rescan && nmtui # search for mentality and run a simple gui
~~~
For USB and SD automount:
~~~
# There is added "exec udiskie -a -n -t" line in sway config for autostart mounting at startapp Sway.   
~~~

## Now copy all configs. 

If you copied nvim configs follow this steps:
~~~
# Installing Vim-Plug plugin.
sh -c 'curl -fLo "${XDG_DATA_HOME:-$HOME/.local/share}"/nvim/site/autoload/plug.vim --create-dirs \
       https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junegunn/vim-plug/master/plug.vim'
~~~
Run this command in nvim.
~~~
:PlugInstall
~~~
